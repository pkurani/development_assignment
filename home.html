            for too long, car shops have been <b>hampered by their lack of usability and simplicity</b>.
            today, we will be designing a page that allows users to easily purchase cars in whatever quantities
            they would like without having to navigate between a bunch of pages. as shown below, all the users have
            to do to purchase a product is simply click view an item and add that item to the cart. an example of how that works is seen below:

         </p>
         <img src="demo1.gif" alt="adding to cart" />
         <p>
            users also have the ability to <b>filter and sort products as they desire</b>, as seen in the gif below:
         </p>
         <img src="demo2.gif" alt="adding to cart" />
         <div class= "sectionHeader">
            issues
         </div>
         <p> the point of this project is to essentially create an <b>user-friendly, minimalist website</b> that allows users to navigate/purchase products without being hampered with interface issues.
           in this section, we will be exploring how the <b>design principles of usability, learnability, memorability, and accessability</b> played a role in the structure and development of the site. </p>
         <div class="subSectionHeader">
            usability
         </div>
         <ul>
            <li>to ensure usability, we had to ensure that all of the buttons worked and that all the edge cases were taken care of. includes <b>ensuring that filter/sort options work, scrolling adapts to page without any issue, and users can add items to cart</b></li>
            <li> another important consideration was for responsiveness. to ensure responsibivesnss to different screen sizes, <b>flexboxes were used to adapt to the size of the page</b> -- ensuring that users got the full experience. </li>
            <li> furthermore, we also display a <b>constantly updated list of products and total in the cart</b>, which ensures that users have all the information they need about the products in their cart </li>

         </ul>
         <div class="subSectionHeader">
            learnability
         </div>
         <ul>
           <li> learnability is accomplished by <b>keeping the website fairly simple</b>. by limiting the number of buttons that appear and labeling them approppriately, learnability does not present a significant issue for this website.
        </ul>
         <div class="subSectionHeader">
            memorability
         </div>
         <ul>
          <li> this is achieved by keeping a <b>simple scanning pattern</b>. the left side of the screen is dedicated to the products, while the left is dedicated to the carts.
          <li>on the left, each product card is displayed in an organized, uniform manner with spacing to "individualize" the cards.</li>
          <li>in the cart, the product list is organized in a uniform manner as well. there is one card per row, thus allowing the cart to abidde by a simple "top to bottom" scanning pattern.</li>

         </ul>
         <div class="subSectionHeader">
            accessability
         </div>
         <ul>
            <li><b>increased contrast between text and background</b> to ensure that everything was extremely visible</li>
            <li> ensured that page works if user needs to increase text size </li>
         </ul>
         <div class= "sectionHeader">
            takeaways
         </div>
         <ul>
            <li> overall, building a website from react was a difficult and ardous process, but it made me more aware of <b>interactions between components</b>, and how the idea of design goes beyond what is just seen on screen </li>
            <li> through this assignment, not only do i have a stronger understanding of the aforementioned processes, but i also believe <b>i can build larger websites with more user interactions to truly create a more "holisitic" experience for a user </b></li>
         </ul>
         <p> hope you like the website! </p>
