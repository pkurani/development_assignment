         <p>
            For too long, car shops have been hampered by their lack of usability and simplicity.
            Today, we will be designing a page that allows users to easily purchase cars in whatever quantities
            they would like without having to navigate between a bunch of pages. As shown below, all the users have
            to do to purchase a product is simply click view an item and add that item to the cart. An example of how that works is seen below:

         </p>
         <img src="demo1.gif" alt="adding to cart" />
         <p>
            Users also have the ability to filter and sort products as they desire, as seen in the gif below:
         </p>
         <img src="demo2.gif" alt="adding to cart" />
         <div class= "sectionHeader">
            Issues
         </div>
         <p> The point of this project is to essentially create an user-friendly website that allows users to navigate/purchase products without being hampered with interface issues.
           In this section, we will be exploring how the design principles of Usability, Learnability, Memorability, and Accessability played a role in the structure and development of the site. </p>
         <div class="subSectionHeader">
            Usability
         </div>
         <ul>
            <li>To ensure usability, we had to ensure that all of the buttons worked and that all the edge cases were taken care of. Includes ensuring that filter/sort options work, scrolling adapts to page without any issue, and users can add items to cart</li>
            <li> Another important consideration was for responsiveness. To ensure responsibivesnss to different screen sizes, flexboxes were used to adapt to the size of the page -- ensuring that users got the full experience. </li>
            <li> Furthermore, we also display a constantly updated list of products and total in the cart, which ensures that users have all the information they need about the products in their cart </li>

         </ul>
         <div class="subSectionHeader">
            Learnability
         </div>
         <ul>
           <li> Learnability is accomplished by keeping the website fairly simple. By limiting the number of buttons that appear and labeling them approppriately, learnability does not present a significant issue for this website.
        </ul>
         <div class="subSectionHeader">
            Memorability
         </div>
         <ul>
          <li> This is achieved by keeping a simple scanning pattern. The left side of the screen is dedicated to the products, while the left is dedicated to the carts.
          <li>On the left, each product card is displayed in an organized, uniform manner with spacing to "individualize" the cards.</li>
          <li>In the cart, the product list is organized in a uniform manner as well. There is one card per row, thus allowing the cart to abidde by a simple "top to bottom" scanning pattern.</li>

         </ul>
         <div class="subSectionHeader">
            Accessability
         </div>
         <ul>
            <li>Increased contrast between text and background to ensure that everything was extremely visible</li>
            <li> Ensured that page works if user needs to increase text size </li>
         </ul>
         <div class= "sectionHeader">
            Takeaways
         </div>
         <ul>
            <li> Overall, building a website from React was a difficult and ardous process, but it made me more aware of interactions between componnets, and how the idea of design goes beyond what is just seen on screen </li>
            <li> Through this assignment, not only do I have a stronger understanding of the aforementioned processes, but I also believe I can build larger websites with more user interactions to truly create a more "holisitc" experience for a user </li>
         </ul>
         <p> Hope you like the website! </p>
